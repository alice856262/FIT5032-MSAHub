      <h1>About MSA</h1>
      <p>
        Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of symptoms that affect both the autonomic nervous system and movement. 
        It is a progressive condition, meaning it worsens over time. MSA can lead to symptoms such as muscle rigidity, tremors, and impaired coordination. 
        While the exact cause of MSA is unknown, research is ongoing to better understand this disease and find effective treatments.
